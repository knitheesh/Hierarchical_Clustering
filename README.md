# Project Title :

Analysis and Prediction of "Mall_Customers.csv" of American mall market called as phonix mall, to find out on the basis of client requirments of dendrograms using scipy graphics library with the help of "scipy.cluster.hierarchy", to ace the no linkage of clustering to predict. 


# Problem statement :

The American finance market client as per the rate of GDP of 2011 found as highest no of growth in their business market. As data science engineer find out which hierarcchy cluster use maximum linkage in upcomming future.

## TASK :

1  With the help of scipy library import the librarys and dataset 

2  Using the dentogram to find the optimal no of clusters.

3  Create a hierarchy model and visualize the cluster with the help of matplotlib library.

# Insights :

1  cluster one contains (Red) which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum Ecluid distence from the centroid up to annual income approximate 139 ks.

2  Cluster 2 two contains (blue) which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum Ecluid distance from centroid up to annual income approximate 79-80 ks.

3  Cluster 2 two contains (green) which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum Ecluid distance from centroid up to annual income approximate  139 ks

4  Cluster 2 two contains (cyan) which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum Ecluid distance from centroid up to annual income approximate 40 ks

5  Cluster 2 two contains (magenta) which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum Ecluid distance from centroid up to annual income approximate 42 ks

# Conclusion :

According to the model building as a engineer my prediction is cluster no 3 has given the highest no linkage.
